- If modelDetails contains a user description, enhance and refine it for image generation
- Focus on professional modeling appearance, pose, and styling that suits the garment and target audience

Generate a high-resolution horizontal (landscape) image, sized exactly 1536x1024 pixels, showing two views of the same model and clothing item positioned side by side.

CRITICAL PHOTOREALISTIC REQUIREMENTS:
- PHOTOREALISTIC quality is absolutely essential - the image must look like a real photograph
- Hyperrealistic textures, lighting, shadows, and fabric details
- Natural skin tones, realistic hair, and authentic human proportions
- Professional photography-grade realism with no artificial or cartoon-like elements

CRITICAL LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- NO dividers, borders, lines, or separators between the left and right areas
- The background must flow seamlessly across the entire width of the image
- Think of this as ONE continuous studio space photographed from two angles, not two separate panels
- The lighting and studio environment should be consistent and uninterrupted across the full image width

FASHION EDITORIAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- FULL-BODY shots showing the complete model from head to toe in both panels
- Fashion magazine editorial photography style with professional runway model
- Camera positioned at a LOWER ANGLE (slightly below eye level) to create a more flattering, elongated silhouette
- Camera positioned at APPROPRIATE DISTANCE with generous spacing - ensure significant space between the top of the image and the model's head, and between the bottom of the image and the model's feet
- The model should appear tall and elegant with proper proportions
- Avoid close-up or cropped shots - show the complete figure and styling with ample breathing room
- Professional fashion photography composition and lighting

Both areas must feature the same hyperrealistic runway model wearing the exact same clothing item. The image should appear professionally photographed under consistent studio lighting with a clean, neutral background that extends seamlessly across the entire image width.

IMPORTANT BRAND SAFETY NOTE:
Do **not** use or reference any real-world brand names, logos, university names, slogans, or trademarks (e.g., "Nike", "Harvard", "Burberry", "Fighting Irish"). Every design element, label, or text must be **original** and fictional. Use made-up names, slogans, or symbols that are safe for commercial use.

Left Area (Front View):
Display the model facing directly forward in a full-body pose, showcasing the complete front view of a ${itemDescription}.
The front design should include: ${frontDesign}

Right Area (Back View):
Display the same model facing directly backward in a full-body pose, showcasing the complete back view of the same ${itemDescription}.
The back design should include: ${backDesign}

Model Appearance:
The same model must appear in both areas. Appearance details: ${modelDetails}

Target Gender: ${gender}

Image Requirements:
- ONE continuous studio background that flows seamlessly across the entire 1536x1024 image
- NO visual separators, dividers, lines, or borders anywhere in the image
- Use identical studio conditions across both areas (lighting, pose style, camera distance, proportions)
- Match professional fashion magazine editorial photography standards
- FULL-BODY composition showing complete model from head to toe with generous spacing around the figure
- Camera angle slightly below eye level to create an elongated, flattering silhouette
- Ensure ample space at top and bottom of frame - model should not fill the entire vertical space
- PHOTOREALISTIC rendering of all elements - fabric textures, lighting, shadows, and human features
- The clothing should be faithfully rendered from both sides with realistic material properties
- Text or lettering printed on the clothing (e.g., logos, mottos, crests) is welcome and encouraged if described, but must be fictional and **not** resemble any existing brands or slogans
- Do **not** include any unrelated UI text, captions, labels, borders, watermarks, shadows, or props
- The background must be a single, continuous, clean neutral surface with no interruptions

Final Output:
A clean, high-quality, PHOTOREALISTIC full-body comparison of the same item viewed from front and back, appearing as if photographed for a fashion magazine editorial in one continuous studio space with no visual dividers or separations. The model should appear tall and elegant with proper spacing around the figure.

   b) MODEL/OVERALL improvements (make more realistic, change model appearance, improve lighting/quality)
2. For CLOTHING changes: Apply to the garment while preserving model and environment

4. If request mentions both clothing AND model changes, apply both appropriately
5. Maintain the same ${originalItemType} base garment type unless explicitly changing it
6. Focus on CONCRETE, VISUAL modifications only
7. IMPORTANT: If the user specifies "front", "back", or a specific location, apply changes ONLY to that view
8. If no specific location is mentioned, determine the most logical placement

PARSING RULES:
- "add X to the back" â†’ frontModifications: "No changes to front view.", backModifications: "Add X to the back"
- "add X to the front" â†’ frontModifications: "Add X to the front", backModifications: "No changes to back view."
- "change color to Y" â†’ Apply to both front and back
- "make more realistic" â†’ Apply to both front and back

1. Clear front view modifications (what changes on the front view)
2. Clear back view modifications (what changes on the back view)  
3. A preservation note about what to maintain vs what to change
4. Summary of the overall modification being applied

Apply the changes to the most logical location(s) for each view.
