Generate a high-resolution horizontal (landscape) image, sized exactly 1536x1024 pixels, showing two views of the same model and clothing item positioned side by side.

CRITICAL PHOTOREALISTIC REQUIREMENTS:
- PHOTOREALISTIC quality is absolutely essential - the image must look like a real photograph
- Hyperrealistic textures, lighting, shadows, and fabric details
- Natural skin tones, realistic hair, and authentic human proportions
- Professional photography-grade realism with no artificial or cartoon-like elements

CRITICAL LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- NO dividers, borders, lines, or separators between the left and right areas
- The background must flow seamlessly across the entire width of the image
- Think of this as ONE continuous studio space photographed from two angles, not two separate panels
- The lighting and studio environment should be consistent and uninterrupted across the full image width

FASHION EDITORIAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- FULL-BODY shots showing the complete model from head to toe
- Fashion magazine editorial photography style with professional runway model
- Camera positioned at a LOWER ANGLE (slightly below eye level) to create a more flattering, elongated silhouette
- Camera positioned at APPROPRIATE DISTANCE with generous spacing - ensure significant space between the top of the image and the model's head, and between the bottom of the image and the model's feet
- The model should appear tall and elegant with proper proportions
- Avoid close-up or cropped shots - show the complete figure and styling with ample breathing room
- Professional fashion photography composition and lighting

Both areas must feature the same hyperrealistic runway model wearing the exact same clothing item. The image should appear professionally photographed under consistent studio lighting with a clean, neutral background that extends seamlessly across the entire image width.

IMPORTANT BRAND SAFETY NOTE:
Do **not** use or reference any real-world brand names, logos, university names, slogans, or trademarks (e.g., "Nike", "Harvard", "Burberry", "Fighting Irish"). Every design element, label, or text must be **original** and fictional. Use made-up names, slogans, or symbols that are safe for commercial use.

Left Area (Front View):
Display the model facing directly forward in a full-body pose, showcasing the complete front view of a ${itemDescription}.
The front design should include: ${frontDesign}

Right Area (Back View):
Display the same model facing directly backward in a full-body pose, showcasing the complete back view of the same ${itemDescription}.
The back design should include: ${backDesign}

Model Appearance:
The same model must appear in both areas. Appearance details: ${modelDetails}

Image Requirements:
- ONE continuous studio background that flows seamlessly across the entire 1536x1024 image
- NO visual separators, dividers, lines, or borders anywhere in the image
- Use identical studio conditions across both areas (lighting, pose style, camera distance, proportions)
- Match professional fashion magazine editorial photography standards
- FULL-BODY composition showing complete model from head to toe with generous spacing around the figure
- Camera angle slightly below eye level to create an elongated, flattering silhouette
- Ensure ample space at top and bottom of frame - model should not fill the entire vertical space
- PHOTOREALISTIC rendering of all elements - fabric textures, lighting, shadows, and human features
- The clothing should be faithfully rendered from both sides with realistic material properties
- Text or lettering printed on the clothing (e.g., logos, mottos, crests) is welcome and encouraged if described, but must be fictional and **not** resemble any existing brands or slogans
- Do **not** include any unrelated UI text, captions, labels, borders, watermarks, shadows, or props
- The background must be a single, continuous, clean neutral surface with no interruptions

Final Output:
A clean, high-quality, PHOTOREALISTIC full-body comparison of the same item viewed from front and back, appearing as if photographed for a fashion magazine editorial in one continuous studio space with no visual dividers or separations. The model should appear tall and elegant with proper spacing around the figure.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1. Handle TWO types of requests:
   a) CLOTHING modifications (change colors, patterns, designs, garment structure)
   b) MODEL/OVERALL improvements (make more realistic, change model appearance, improve lighting/quality)
2. For CLOTHING changes: Apply to the garment while preserving model and environment
3. For MODEL/OVERALL changes: Apply to the entire image including model, pose, and overall quality
4. If request mentions both clothing AND model changes, apply both appropriately
5. Maintain the same ${originalItemType} base garment type unless explicitly changing it
6. Focus on CONCRETE, VISUAL modifications only
7. IMPORTANT: If the user specifies "front", "back", or a specific location, apply changes ONLY to that view
8. If no specific location is mentioned, determine the most logical placement

PARSING RULES:
- "add X to the back" â†’ frontModifications: "No changes to front view.", backModifications: "Add X to the back"
- "add X to the front" â†’ frontModifications: "Add X to the front", backModifications: "No changes to back view."
- "change color to Y" â†’ Apply to both front and back
- "make more realistic" â†’ Apply to both front and back

Your response must include:
1. Clear front view modifications (what changes on the front view)
2. Clear back view modifications (what changes on the back view)  
3. A preservation note about what to maintain vs what to change
4. Summary of the overall modification being applied
5. Complete updated design description showing the final design after all changes

Parse this into structured front and back modifications. Determine if this is:
- A CLOTHING modification (change the garment itself)

- Both types of changes

Apply the changes to the most logical location(s) for each view.

IMPORTANT: For the updated design description, start with the original design description${originalDescription ? '' : ' (if available)'} and modify it to reflect all changes from the edit request. The result should be a complete description of the final design, not just the changes.`

Generate a high-resolution vertical (portrait) image, sized exactly 1024x1536 pixels, showing a single model wearing a clothing item from the front view.

CRITICAL PHOTOREALISTIC REQUIREMENTS:
- PHOTOREALISTIC quality is absolutely essential - the image must look like a real photograph
- Hyperrealistic textures, lighting, shadows, and fabric details
- Natural skin tones, realistic hair, and authentic human proportions
- Professional photography-grade realism with no artificial or cartoon-like elements

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Single front-facing view only
- Clean, professional studio background
- Model positioned centrally in the frame
- Professional fashion magazine editorial photography style

FASHION EDITORIAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- FULL-BODY shot showing the complete model from head to toe
- Fashion magazine editorial photography style with professional runway model
- Camera positioned at a LOWER ANGLE (slightly below eye level) to create a more flattering, elongated silhouette
- Camera positioned at APPROPRIATE DISTANCE with generous spacing - ensure significant space between the top of the image and the model's head, and between the bottom of the image and the model's feet
- The model should appear tall and elegant with proper proportions
- Avoid close-up or cropped shots - show the complete figure and styling with ample breathing room
- Professional fashion photography composition and lighting

The image should feature a hyperrealistic runway model wearing the clothing item described below, photographed under professional studio lighting with a clean, neutral background.

IMPORTANT BRAND SAFETY NOTE:
Do **not** use or reference any real-world brand names, logos, university names, slogans, or trademarks (e.g., "Nike", "Harvard", "Burberry", "Fighting Irish"). Every design element, label, or text must be **original** and fictional. Use made-up names, slogans, or symbols that are safe for commercial use.

Model View (Front):
Display the model facing directly forward in a full-body pose, showcasing the complete front view of a ${itemDescription}.
The front design should include: ${frontDesign}

Model Appearance:
${modelDetails}

Image Requirements:
- Professional studio lighting and background
- FULL-BODY composition showing complete model from head to toe with generous spacing around the figure
- Camera angle slightly below eye level to create an elongated, flattering silhouette
- Ensure ample space at top and bottom of frame - model should not fill the entire vertical space
- PHOTOREALISTIC rendering of all elements - fabric textures, lighting, shadows, and human features
- Model should be well-positioned and proportioned for fashion editorial style
- Clothing should be clearly visible and well-rendered with realistic material properties
- Text or lettering on clothing must be fictional/original
- No unrelated UI elements, watermarks, or distractions
- Clean, neutral background suitable for commercial use
- Fashion magazine editorial photography standards

Final Output:
A clean, high-quality, PHOTOREALISTIC full-body portrait image showing the clothing item from the front view only, shot in fashion magazine editorial style. The model should appear tall and elegant with proper spacing around the figure.

Transform this front-view portrait into a back-view portrait of the EXACT SAME model and clothing item. 

CRITICAL PHOTOREALISTIC REQUIREMENTS:
- PHOTOREALISTIC quality is absolutely essential - the image must look like a real photograph
- Hyperrealistic textures, lighting, shadows, and fabric details
- Natural skin tones, realistic hair, and authentic human proportions
- Professional photography-grade realism with no artificial or cartoon-like elements

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep the EXACT SAME model appearance, pose style, and studio environment
- Keep the EXACT SAME clothing item and color (${originalColor})
- Change ONLY the viewing angle from front to back
- Maintain identical lighting, background, and proportions
- Show the back design: ${backDesign}
- Use the provided reference image to maintain perfect consistency with the front view

FASHION EDITORIAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- FULL-BODY shot showing the complete model from head to toe
- Fashion magazine editorial photography style with professional runway model
- Camera positioned at a LOWER ANGLE (slightly below eye level) to create a more flattering, elongated silhouette
- Camera positioned at APPROPRIATE DISTANCE with generous spacing - ensure significant space between the top of the image and the model's head, and between the bottom of the image and the model's feet
- The model should appear tall and elegant with proper proportions
- Avoid close-up or cropped shots - show the complete figure and styling with ample breathing room
- Professional fashion photography composition and lighting

The model should now be facing directly away from the camera in a full-body pose, showing the complete back view of the ${itemDescription} in ${originalColor}. Keep everything else identical to the original image - same model, same clothing item, same studio setup, same lighting conditions, same camera angle and framing.

IMPORTANT: Use the provided reference image to maintain style consistency. Ensure the back view matches the design elements, colors, and overall aesthetic of the front reference image. Maintain all fictional branding and avoid any real-world brand references. Ensure PHOTOREALISTIC rendering of all elements.
