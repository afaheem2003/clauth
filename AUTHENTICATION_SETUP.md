# Enhanced Authentication Setup Guide

## Overview

Your Clauth application now supports two authentication methods:

1. **Google OAuth** (existing, enhanced)
2. **Email/Password with Phone Verification** (new)

## Required Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Twilio SMS for Phone Verification
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number_here
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Twilio SMS Setup

1. Sign up at [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. Get a phone number (trial accounts get a free number)
3. Find your Account SID and Auth Token in the console
4. Add them to your `.env.local` file

### 2. Development Mode

For development, phone verification will work without Twilio credentials:

- Verification codes will be logged to the console
- SMS won't be sent, but the flow will work
- You can test with any 6-digit code

## New Features

### Phone Verification Flow

1. User signs up with email/password
2. Account is created but phone is not verified
3. SMS with 6-digit code is sent
4. User enters code to complete verification
5. Only verified users can sign in with email/password

### Enhanced Login Page

- Tabbed interface for Social vs Email/Password login
- Beautiful Google login button
- Form validation and error handling

### Enhanced Signup Page

- Two-step process: Account creation â†’ Phone verification
- Real-time form validation
- Countdown timer for verification codes
- Resend code functionality
- Progress indicator

## User Flow

### New User Journey

1. **Landing**: `/waitlist` - Beautiful landing page
2. **Signup**: `/signup` - Create account with phone verification
3. **Login**: `/login` - Sign in with any method
4. **Status**: `/waitlist-status` - View waitlist status

### Authentication Methods

- **Google**: Instant access, added to waitlist
- **Email/Password**: Requires phone verification first

## Database Changes

### New Fields in User Model

- `password`: Hashed password for email/password auth
- `phone`: Phone number (unique)
- `phoneVerified`: Timestamp when phone was verified

### New PhoneVerification Model

- Stores verification codes and expiration
- Tracks verification attempts
- Automatically cleaned up after verification

## Security Features

### Phone Verification

- 6-digit random codes
- 10-minute expiration
- Maximum 5 attempts per code
- Rate limiting on resend
- Secure code generation

### Password Security

- Minimum 8 characters required
- Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds: 12
- Password confirmation required

### Session Management

- JWT-based sessions via NextAuth
- Proper role-based access control
- Waitlist status tracking

## API Endpoints

### New Authentication APIs

- `POST /api/auth/signup` - Create account with phone
- `POST /api/auth/send-verification` - Send SMS verification code
- `POST /api/auth/verify-phone` - Verify phone number
- `GET /api/user/check-new` - Check if user is newly registered

## Testing

### Development Testing

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/signup` to test email/password signup
3. Check console for verification codes (no Twilio needed)
4. Test Google login (should work with existing setup)

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Twilio account set up with phone number
- [ ] Environment variables added to production
- [ ] Database migrated with new schema
- [ ] SSL certificate for HTTPS (required for OAuth)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **SMS not sending**: Verify Twilio credentials and phone number format
2. **Phone verification fails**: Check if codes are expired or attempt limit reached
3. **Database errors**: Ensure schema is migrated with `npx prisma db push`

### Development Tips

- Use `console.log` to debug verification codes
- Test with different phone number formats
- Check browser network tab for API errors
- Verify environment variables are loaded

## Next Steps

1. Configure Twilio for SMS (optional for development)
2. Test the complete authentication flow
3. Customize the UI/UX as needed
4. Add additional security measures if required

The authentication system is now fully functional with modern security practices and a great user experience!
